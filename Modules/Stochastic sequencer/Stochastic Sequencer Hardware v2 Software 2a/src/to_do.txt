- DONE:make the 2nd cv knob affect the P slider values. First need to think about the maths of what I actually want it to do
- make a LED indicator for the adjusted LED slider values, just to check that the feel is what it should be. 





You can hear the voltatge wobble in the V sliders, if the values are no quantized
 
it is not sensitive to triggers from my clock divider. (May be the fault of my clock divider!)

the "skip" probability option causes cycles to end prematurely

the trigger outputs still need coding up

silent/inactivated steps still contribute to the voltage output 




- link up trigger inputs to cycling 
- develop input/output bits
- add accent


Step length control seems to work ok, but it would be really helpful if there was visual
feedback on what the "length" of the P sliders is. 

There is no way turn a channel "off" once started
